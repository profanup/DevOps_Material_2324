While both a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and a prototype serve important roles in product development, they have distinct differences in purpose and functionality:

1. Purpose:
   - MVP: The purpose of an MVP is to validate the viability of a product or business idea in the market. It aims to deliver value to early adopters or customers and gather feedback to validate assumptions, understand user needs, and guide further development.
   - Prototype: The purpose of a prototype is to demonstrate the functionality and design of a product concept or specific features. It helps visualize and test ideas, gather feedback, and make design decisions before moving forward with development.

2. Functionality:
   - MVP: An MVP includes the minimum set of features necessary to provide a viable solution and deliver value to early users or customers. It focuses on core functionalities that address specific user needs and pain points.
   - Prototype: A prototype may not have full functionality and may not be fully functional or usable. It aims to showcase specific features, interactions, or design elements to gather feedback and test concepts.

3. Development Stage:
   - MVP: An MVP is developed after the initial concept and planning stage, with the goal of releasing a functional version of the product to early adopters or customers. It is typically developed with the intent to learn, iterate, and refine the product based on user feedback.
   - Prototype: A prototype is often created during the early stages of product development, even before the full design and development process begins. It is used to test and validate ideas, gather feedback, and make design decisions.

4. User Feedback:
   - MVP: An MVP is designed to gather user feedback and validate assumptions about the product's value proposition, functionality, and market fit. The feedback collected from early users helps guide future iterations and development efforts.
   - Prototype: A prototype is used to gather feedback on specific design elements, interactions, or features. The feedback helps refine the design, make improvements, and validate usability.

5. Time and Effort:
   - MVP: An MVP is developed with the minimum required effort and resources to quickly release a functional product. It focuses on delivering value efficiently while managing development costs and time to market.
   - Prototype: A prototype may require less effort and resources compared to developing a full product. It is often created using rapid prototyping techniques and tools to explore ideas and concepts without investing heavily in development.

In summary, an MVP and a prototype differ in their purpose, functionality, stage of development, and focus on user feedback. An MVP is aimed at validating a product's viability, delivering value to users, and gathering feedback for further development. On the other hand, a prototype is used to test and validate design concepts, gather feedback on specific features, and make design decisions before moving into full development.
