The software lifecycle, also known as the software development lifecycle (SDLC), consists of several distinct phases that collectively encompass the process of creating and maintaining software applications. Although different methodologies may have variations in the names and order of these phases, the following are the typical phases in the software lifecycle:

1. Requirements Gathering/Analysis:
   In this phase, stakeholders, including users, clients, and developers, identify and define the requirements and goals of the software. This involves understanding the problem domain, gathering functional and non-functional requirements, and determining the scope of the project.

2. Design:
   The design phase involves creating a blueprint for the software solution based on the gathered requirements. It includes architectural design, system design, database design, and user interface (UI) design. The goal is to create a design that addresses the requirements and allows for efficient and effective implementation.

3. Development/Implementation:
   In this phase, the actual coding and programming of the software occur. Developers write code based on the design specifications, following coding standards and best practices. This phase includes tasks such as coding, unit testing, integration testing, and fixing any defects identified during testing.

4. Testing:
   Testing is an integral part of the software lifecycle and aims to ensure that the software meets the specified requirements and functions as intended. It involves various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and performance testing. The goal is to identify and rectify any defects or issues before the software is deployed.

5. Deployment/Release:
   The deployment phase involves making the software available to end-users or clients. It includes activities like installation, configuration, and deployment of the software on the target environment. Proper documentation, user training, and support mechanisms may also be included in this phase.

6. Maintenance:
   Once the software is deployed, the maintenance phase begins. It involves activities such as bug fixes, updates, enhancements, and addressing user feedback or support requests. Maintenance ensures that the software remains functional, secure, and up-to-date over its lifetime.

7. Retirement/End of Life:
   Eventually, software reaches its end of life, where it is no longer actively maintained or supported. This phase involves archiving the software, transitioning users to alternative solutions, and decommissioning any associated infrastructure.

It's important to note that these phases are not always strictly linear, and iterative or Agile methodologies may involve overlapping or iterative cycles. Different methodologies, such as Waterfall, Agile, or DevOps, may have variations in the phases or their order. The selection of the appropriate software development lifecycle model depends on project requirements, team dynamics, and other factors.
